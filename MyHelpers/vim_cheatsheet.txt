Copying and inserting elements:
gp - pastes the content from the clipboard and moves the cursor to the next line?
gP - pastes the content from the clipboard and creates a new line

- The behavior of `p` and `P` depends on what you've copied with the `y` command:
  -if you copied characters:
    - if you press p: you will paste it after the cursor and the cursor will move to the first char of what you pasted
    - if you press P: you will paste it before the cursor and the cursor will move to the last char of what you pasted
    - if you press gp: you will paste it after the cursor and the cursor will move to the nex char after the last char of the thing you pasted
    - if you press gP: you will paste it before the cursor and the cursor will stay where it was
  - If you copied lines like with yy:
    - if you press p: you will paste it in the line below and the cursor will move to the first char of what you pasted 
    - if you press P: you will paste it in the line bellow and the cursor will move to the first char of the line you were at
    - if you press gp: you will paste it in the line below and the cursor will move to the first char of the line next to the line you pasted
    - if you press gP: you will paste it in the line avobe and the cursor will move to the first char of the line you were aleady at 
- You can copy or duplicate entire lines by using `yyp`
