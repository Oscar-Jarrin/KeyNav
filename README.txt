Key Polar Navigation is a program that allows you to use your keyboard to replace your mouse movements 
based on the idea of a polar plane projected on the screen that can allow you to specify the point of the screen
you want to move your cursor to.

It also allows you to simulare some of the commands you would use in vim's insert mode and normal mode to have a 
similar navigation experience throughout your whole device
