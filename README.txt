KeyNav is a concieved to allow you to fluently use your computer only using your keyboard.

This is achieved by switching your keyboard between modes (you can also see it as layers) and each layer
has a set of functionalities like moving your cursor arround the screen, navigate through text, or, 
if you happen to need it, you have a mode to use your keyboard as if KeyNav wasn't running.

Hope you find it useful.
